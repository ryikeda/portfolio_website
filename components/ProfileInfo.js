        <p>
          I spent my childhood in Brazil, my teen years in Japan and I went to
          the USA for my college degree. Nowadays, I live in Japan where I work
          as a software engineer.

          When Iâ€™m not coding or studying I usually hang out with my one year
          old son and my wife. I also like to play the guitar or watch a movie
          to relax.
