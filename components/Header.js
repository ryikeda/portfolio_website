              I'm a full-stack engineer based in Tokyo. It always amazes me how
              when can solve real problems with code, in fact it's one of the
              reasons that led me to this path.

              A bit more about me...
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="h6" className={classes.headerText}>
              I spent my childhood in Brazil, my teen years in Japan and I went
              to the USA for a college degree. By living and working in such
              different environments I found myself having to adapt to
              situations that most people will never have the chance to
              experience. It can be stressful sometimes, however, all those
              experiences allowed me to have a unique perspective on problem
              solving, which can be very helpful when developing a new
              application.
